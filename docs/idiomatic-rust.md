# shep — Idiomatic Rust Spec

House rules for all shep code, distilled from a deep read of `rand` 0.10.2 (the
quality bar). Numbered rules — cite as `IR-<n>` in reviews. Full pattern
citations with file:line evidence live in [idiomatic-rust/lenses/](idiomatic-rust/lenses/)
(api, docs, testing, rigor). This doc is the contract; the lenses are the proof.

Priority when rules collide: **Readability > KISS > DRY** (the maintainer's global order).

## A. Workspace & Cargo

- **IR-1** Shared config in `[workspace.package]` / `[workspace.dependencies]` /
  `[workspace.lints]`; every crate opts in (`lints.workspace = true`). rand
  predates workspace lints — we use the modern equivalent of its discipline.
- **IR-2** Every dependency `default-features = false` + enumerate needed
  features. Dev-deps too, with purpose comments (`# Only to test serde`).
- **IR-3** Features: additive only, compose upward (`otel = ["metrics", ...]`),
  optional deps via `dep:`, weak deps via `serde?/derive`. Every feature line
  carries a `# Option:` / `# Option (enabled by default):` comment stating its
  consequence. Never a feature that removes behavior. Gate convenience layers,
  never core trait/type definitions.
- **IR-4** Each publishable crate: `rust-version` (MSRV 1.88), `include = [...]`
  slim list, `[package.metadata.docs.rs]` with `all-features = true` +
  `--generate-link-to-definition` + the local repro command as a comment.
- **IR-5** Benches: separate unpublished crate (`publish = false`, own
  `[workspace]`), criterion `harness = false`, deterministic fixtures inside,
  `black_box` in/out, CI compiles+runs them so they never rot.

## B. Lints

- **IR-6** Workspace denies: `missing_docs`, `missing_debug_implementations`,
  `clippy::undocumented_unsafe_blocks`. Each lib.rs adds
  `#![doc(test(attr(deny(warnings))))]` — doctests rot loudly.
- **IR-7** `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` in shep-core, shep-client, shep.
  shep-daemon: deny (nix/libc needs escape hatches — see IR-24).
- **IR-8** `#[allow]` only at the narrowest scope (fn/block), enumerated lint,
  one-line reason comment. Never file- or crate-wide without justification.
- **IR-9** `clippy.toml`: `doc-valid-idents = ["PID", "SIGKILL", "systemd",
  "OTel", ".."]` — keep `..` to preserve defaults; comment says why.

## C. API design

- **IR-10** Two-layer traits: minimal dyn-safe core trait + blanket ext trait
  whose methods are ALL defaulted (`impl<T: Core + ?Sized> Ext for T {}`).
  Generic fns take `&mut T where T: Core + ?Sized`. Pin dyn-compat with a
  `&mut dyn Core` smoke test.
- **IR-11** Newtypes pin public contracts (`MemSize(u64)`, `ProcessId(u32)`,
  `AuthToken`); forwarding methods are `#[inline]` one-liners. A `// wire
  format: changing this is a breaking change` comment on every wire-facing type.
- **IR-12** Conversions: `From` only when infallible; `TryFrom` with a typed
  error otherwise (`"512M".try_into()` → `Result<MemSize, ParseMemSizeError>`).
  Never a panicking `From`.
- **IR-13** Assoc type when exactly one impl per type (`Request::Response`);
  generic param when many. Typed RPC: each request type registers its response
  type once in shep-core — mismatch is a compile error, not a decode error.
- **IR-14** Natural-input traits at API edges (rand's `SampleRange`): selectors
  accept `impl IntoSelector` so `restart("web")`, `restart(ProcessId(3))`,
  `restart(All)` all read naturally. Implement only where meaningful.
- **IR-15** Storable iterators/streams are NAMED public structs (honest
  `size_hint`, `FusedStream` where true); `-> impl Stream` only for one-off
  views. `PhantomData<fn() -> T>` for variance-neutral phantoms.
- **IR-16** Renames ship a `#[deprecated(since, note = "Renamed to `x`")]`
  delegating shim for one release. No silent breaks.
- **IR-17** `#[must_use]` only where discarding is a plausible bug; intentional
  discards written `let _ =`.

## D. Errors

- **IR-18** Small per-module error enums named for their construction site
  (`SpawnError` in daemon, `ConnectError` in client, `ProtocolError` in core
  next to the wire types). No crate-wide mega-enum; no `anyhow` outside
  shep.
- **IR-19** Shape: derive `Debug, Clone, PartialEq, Eq` (+ `Copy` when
  fieldless); per-variant doc = the precise condition ("stale socket file"),
  not the name restated; manual `Display` via `f.write_str(match ...)`;
  `impl core::error::Error`. Variants wrapping `io::Error` implement `source()`
  and drop `Copy`/`Eq` for that enum only.
- **IR-20** `#[non_exhaustive]` only where growth is anticipated, with a
  comment citing why (`ProtocolError`: wire will grow). It taxes downstream
  matching — don't cargo-cult it. The default that settles the usual case: a
  `pub` error enum in a LIBRARY crate (shep-core, shep-daemon, shep-client)
  gets it, because an out-of-tree consumer can match exhaustively and a new
  variant would break them with no version bump to say so; a `pub` error enum
  in shep does not — not because the crate is `[[bin]]`-only (Phase 15 gave it
  a `[lib]` target plus three `[[bin]]`s over it), but because its library
  surface is deliberately three `ExitCode`-returning entry points (`main`,
  `main_runtime`, `main_dev`) and nothing else: every module stays private
  `mod`, so no error enum the crate defines is externally reachable at all —
  `#[non_exhaustive]` would guard a match no one outside the crate can write.
  The rule still holds; only the reason changed. Either way the comment is
  mandatory — `CronScheduleError` is the model for the negative case. Every
  wire enum gets it unconditionally, and so does `ProcessInfo`, the one wire
  STRUCT (Phase 10, wire audit #1).
- **IR-21** Constructors return `Result`, validation-first with early returns.
  Panicking conveniences exist only in shep, carry `#[track_caller]` +
  `# Panics` doc (the two travel together, one commit), and panic messages
  include the offending value.

## E. Unsafe (shep-daemon only)

- **IR-22** All unsafe confined to `shep-daemon/src/sys.rs`; everything else
  calls its safe wrappers.
- **IR-23** Every block: `// SAFETY:` stating the exact invariant, repeated
  verbatim at each site (no "see above"). Pair with `debug_assert!` of the
  invariant when checkable.
- **IR-24** Choosing unsafe over a safe alternative requires a rationale essay
  next to the code: rejected alternative, its measured cost, the invariant, the
  failure scenarios considered and why each can't happen (rand's
  UnsafeCell-vs-RefCell essay is the model).

## F. Performance annotations

- **IR-25** `#[inline(always)]`: trivial forwarding on the per-frame/per-byte
  hot path only. `#[inline]`: small hot fns + cheap constructors crossing crate
  boundaries. `#[cold] #[inline(never)]`: rare paths reached from hot loops
  (protocol-error construction, reconnect, rotation trigger) — hot fn does one
  compare and calls the cold fn; panics/format machinery live in the cold fn.
- **IR-26** Every tuning threshold is a named const with a benchmark-backed
  comment including unit conversion (rand's `RESEED_BLOCK_THRESHOLD` model).
  No inline magic numbers.

## G. Docs

- **IR-27** Crate doc = summary + `# Quick start` with ONE example + links out.
  Module docs are decision guides ("which restart policy when"), not API dumps:
  noun-phrase title (no period), h2 sections, h5 taxonomy sub-groups,
  definition-bullets with honest caveats inline, ALL links in a bottom
  reference block.
- **IR-28** Item-doc section order: summary fragment (no period) → prose/
  See-also → `# Example` → `# Errors` (mandatory for Result fns) → `# Panics`
  (iff it can) → domain section (`# Cancellation safety`, `# Security`) → link
  block. Thin wrappers doc as "shorthand for <code>[X].[y]</code>" — no
  duplicated behavior text.
- **IR-29** ONE canonical `# Security` writeup (on the daemon/socket type),
  anchor-linked from everywhere else. Design-criteria bullets + explicit
  non-goals.
- **IR-30** Doctests: `no_run` default for anything daemon-touching (hidden
  `# #[tokio::main]` wrapper lines); `ignore` only when it can't compile
  in-crate, with prose explaining; edge cases as asserted doctests with
  verdict comments on pure logic (config parse, backoff math) — those run in
  CI. Show the better pattern proactively ("reuse one Client").
- **IR-31** Implementation rationale = `//` block comments above the item,
  never `///`. Rendered docs are for users; essays are for maintainers.
  - **Standing deviation — private items in `shep-daemon` and `shep-cli`.**
    Their rationale stays in `///`. The actor's methods, guards and state
    machines all carry theirs there and the file is unanimous about it, so
    converting some of them splits one file's voice between two comment
    styles for a cosmetic result — Readability first. The rule's stated
    reason does not bite either: rendered docs are a user's, and a private
    item has no user. The honest counter-argument is that
    `--document-private-items` renders them anyway, and it loses to the
    above. Raised and declined twice in review; treat as settled rather than
    re-litigating it per review.

    `shep-cli` was added on 2026-09-13 for the same reason rather than a new
    one. `lookout/view/pane.rs` documents its private functions with `///`
    and none with `//`, so the condition the deviation was written for holds
    there too: converting the two helpers a review had flagged would leave
    two of that file in a different voice from every neighbour, and
    converting the file is a large mechanical diff unrelated to whatever
    change is in flight.
- **IR-32** `#[cfg(doc)] use` for link-only imports; `#[doc(inline)]` on
  curated re-exports; `#[doc(hidden)]` + `// used by shep-daemon` comment for
  workspace-internal surface. Third-party re-exports normalized under our
  namespace (`Error as SysError`).

- **IR-47** A comment says only what the code cannot: an invariant, a
  non-obvious why, a caller constraint, a platform caveat, a number's basis.
  Never history (dates, "used to", "until", phase numbers), never a rejected
  alternative, never a review argument, never a paraphrase of the next line.
  Git history holds all of that. Shape: `//` one or two lines, four at most;
  `///` one summary fragment plus at most six lines of body, twelve counting
  `# Errors`; `//!` three to ten lines. No em dashes, no capitals for
  emphasis, sentences at sixteen words or fewer. A test whose name is a
  sentence needs no doc line. Match the project's own rate: about one prose
  comment line per commit is the maintainer's measured habit, not ten.

## H. Testing

- **IR-33** One crate-root `#[cfg(test)] mod test` fixture module per crate
  with a WHY comment at each factory. shep-daemon's fixtures: paused clock
  (`#[tokio::test(start_paused = true)]` is the default — real time needs a
  justifying comment) and a two-tier fake process runner (`const_proc(exit)` /
  `script_proc(vec![...])`) implementing the real `ProcessRunner` trait. No
  mocking frameworks — hand-rolled fakes against real traits.
- **IR-34** Unique scenario per test: own config literal, own tempdir, own
  seed. No shared mutable fixture state.
- **IR-35** Wire stability = our value-stability: insta snapshots of every
  request/response/event serialized form, PLUS committed byte-fixtures from
  the previous protocol version that must still deserialize. Breaking one is a
  protocol-version bump + CHANGELOG entry, never a silent snapshot re-accept.
- **IR-36** Deterministic-sequence tests: paused clock + scripted runner →
  assert the EXACT restart instants/backoff delays as a pinned array.
- **IR-37** Property tier: proptest on the supervisor state machine (random
  event interleavings uphold invariants: never two live PIDs per unit, restart
  count monotonic, always reaches steady state). Explicit bounds; case count
  capped in CI via env.
- **IR-38** `tests/` dir = at most one compile-only file per crate proving an
  external crate can implement the public trait (`todo!()` bodies fine).
  Everything behavioral is co-located `#[cfg(test)]`.
- **IR-39** E2E tier (shep): `assert_cmd` + fresh temp `SHEP_HOME` per
  test + serde asserts on JSON output + insta snapshots of normalized stdout.
  No sleeps — event-driven waits with timeouts. Errors derive `PartialEq` so
  tests assert exact variants.
- **IR-40** Boundary sweeps as a habit: wire framing tested at every partial-
  read length around the header size; supervisor at 0/1/max processes;
  empty/defaulted configs.
- **IR-46** Every `await` in a test needs a FORCING MECHANISM — something that
  makes it resolve, or makes it fail, within a bound the test itself sets. Two
  failure shapes this catches, both found in five separate phases: an await
  nothing will ever resolve (the test hangs, and a hang reports as a timeout
  minutes later with no diagnostic), and an await that resolves on a state the
  test was not waiting for (`await_status(Online)` satisfied by the state
  BEFORE the crash under test — a vacuous pass, which is worse than a hang
  because it is green). Concretely: wrap the wait in `tokio::time::timeout`
  and assert on the result, or wait for a transition rather than a state, or
  drive a paused clock past the point the thing must have happened by. "The
  test passes locally" is not a forcing mechanism; neither is the harness's
  own process timeout, which fails the whole binary and names nothing.

## I. Security-sensitive types

- **IR-41** Any type carrying env vars, tokens, or secrets: manual redacting
  `Debug` (`AuthToken { .. }`, env values elided) with doc note "Debug does not
  leak X" + an exact-string unit test with the reason commented — a lazy
  `derive(Debug)` refactor must fail CI.
- **IR-42** SECURITY.md as an if/then premises contract: preconditions (runtime
  dir 0700, daemon unprivileged, unix-socket only) → guaranteed properties (no
  cross-user control, tokens never in logs/Debug/RPC), per-component sections,
  explicit non-goals ("root can always read daemon memory"), supported
  versions, private reporting window. The daemon socket is a privilege
  boundary — this file matters more for shep than for most crates.

## J. CI & release

- **IR-43** Jobs: clippy PINNED to a specific toolchain with `-D warnings`
  (bump the pin deliberately in a PR), fmt on stable, docs on nightly with
  `-Dwarnings --cfg docsrs`, typos, weekly cron for drift. `permissions:
  contents: read` on all workflows; `fail-fast: false` on the matrix.
- **IR-44** Matrix: {ubuntu, macos} × {stable, MSRV} + one beta row; nightly
  `-Z minimal-versions` row keeps dep lower bounds honest; musl target RUNS
  tests (deployment artifact — our "big-endian row"); aarch64-musl build-only.
  Feature-combo ladder per crate: `--no-default-features`, each feature singly,
  `--all-features`. miri only if shep-daemon grows real unsafe — no cargo-cult.
- **IR-45** Release: tag-triggered crates.io Trusted Publishing (OIDC,
  `id-token: write`, no stored token). Keep-a-Changelog per publishable crate:
  permanent `[Unreleased]`, sections `Security and unsafe / Fixes / Changes /
  Additions / Removals / Deprecated`, imperative entries, renames spelled
  `old` -> `new`, every line ends `([#NN])`, wire-version bumps called out.
