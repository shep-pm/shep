# Dogs — the shepherd's own plugins

A dog is a process the shepherd supervises for its own sake, not for
yours: it watches the flock rather than being part of it. This is the
practical guide to turning one on, configuring it, and — if you want to
write your own — the contract it has to speak. The behavior contract
itself is pinned in spec [§8](specs/shep-v1.md#8-dogs-plugins);
`docs/shepherd-channel.md` is its sibling for the OTHER kind of process a
shep app can be, and the two are worth telling apart up front: a sheep
that opens the shepherd channel talks to the daemon over fd 3 in newline
JSON. A dog talks to the daemon the way `shep` itself does — as a client,
over the Unix socket.

## What a dog is

A dog is a process speaking the client wire protocol (spec
[§6](specs/shep-v1.md#6-wire-protocol-v1--protocol-version-1)), connected
to `$SHEP_HOME/run/shep.sock` and handshaking exactly as `shep flock` or
`shep describe` would. `PROTOCOL_VERSION` covers a dog exactly as it
covers every other client: a version mismatch is a typed error at
handshake, not silence.

Two dogs ship inside the `shep` binary — `metrics` and `bark` — reached
through the hidden `shep dog <name>` re-exec target, the same shape
`shep daemon` already is. Neither is something you run directly; the
shepherd spawns it.

Underneath, a dog is not a second kind of supervised process. It is an
ordinary sheep with a marker on its entry saying where it came from
(built-in, or an adopted binary). The kill ladder, the backoff curve, the
restart budget, what `Errored` means — none of it branches on whether the
entry is a dog. A dog that restarts is still a dog when it comes back; a
dog whose binary cannot be spawned still shows up in `shep dogs` as
`Errored`, the same way a broken sheep would. `shep flock` prints the
flock as two tables — sheep, then dogs — and `shep dogs` prints the
second one alone. A wildcard selector (`stop all`, `reload all`, `/regex/`)
never touches a dog; naming it exactly always does, which is what makes
`shep disable bark` reach a dog while a sweep of everything else leaves it
running.

## Turning one on

```
shep enable metrics
shep enable bark
shep dogs
shep disable bark
```

`shep enable <name>` writes `$SHEP_HOME/shep.toml` first, and only then —
if a shepherd is reachable — asks it to start the dog. Run it against a
live shepherd and the dog starts now. Run it with nothing listening and
`enable` still exits successfully: the config says the dog belongs, and
the next shepherd that boots brings it up. Neither `enable` nor `disable`
starts a shepherd on your behalf to act on its own edit — that would be a
bigger side effect than a config change should cause, and `shep muster` is
the one verb in this CLI that autostarts anything.

`enable` takes a built-in name or one `shep adopt` has already recorded,
and refuses anything else before it writes:

```
$ shep enable pydog
error[invalid_config]: `pydog` is not a dog; valid names are "metrics"
and "bark" -- if you meant a third-party dog, run `shep adopt pydog` first
```

A refused `enable` writes nothing at all: a `$SHEP_HOME` that had no
`shep.toml` still has none afterwards. The check reads `[daemon]
adopted_dogs`, not the shepherd, so it holds with nothing listening.

The guard is on the verb, not on the file. Write a name into `[daemon]
enabled_dogs` by hand and the shepherd still reads it at boot, still
treats anything outside `[daemon] adopted_dogs` as built-in, and spawns
`shep dog <name>` for it once per restart until the budget is spent. What
that looks like from `shep dogs` is a climbing restart count against a
`SOURCE` of `built-in`, for a name that is not one; `shep bleats <name>`
is where the refusal itself shows up.

`shep disable <name>` is the mirror: it stops the dog if one is running,
and removes it from the boot list either way. It carries no name check of
its own, deliberately, so it is what takes a hand-written entry back out
of `enabled_dogs`.

Running two of these at once is safe. A provisioning script that
backgrounds `shep adopt` and `shep enable` together has each of them take
an exclusive lock on `shep.toml` for its whole read-edit-write, so the
second waits its turn instead of writing back a document it read before
the first one's edit landed.

`dogs.toml` has a lock of its own on the same terms, and it needs one for
the same reason: its writers rewrite the whole file rather than a line of
it. Two of them exist, `shep rehome` and the once-per-home migration a
boot runs, and each holds that lock across its whole read-edit-write. So
two backgrounded `shep rehome` calls for two different dogs both land,
and a rehome that overlaps a boot does not undo the migration or get
undone by it. A boot that holds both locks takes `shep.toml`'s first.

## Configuration

A dog's settings live under `[<name>]` in `$SHEP_HOME/dogs.toml`, hand-editable
and separate from `shep.toml`, and they never travel through the dog's
environment. Instead the dog connects to the socket and asks for its own
section over the wire (`Request::DogConfig`), the daemon reads the file
fresh for every such request rather than serving a copy it cached at boot.

**Editing `[<name>]` in `dogs.toml` does not reach a dog that is already
running.** A running dog asked for its section once, at startup, and
nothing pushes it a new one. `shep disable <name> && shep enable <name>`
is what re-reads it: that stop/start cycle is a fresh process asking a
fresh question, and the daemon answers off the file as it stands at that
moment.

**A dog can subscribe instead of waiting to be bounced.** Shep publishes on
`config.dog.<name>` when it changes a dog's section itself. A dog holding a
subscription re-asks with `Request::DogConfig` and decides what the change
means: swap the values, rebind a listener, or ask for its own restart. The
frame says that the section changed and nothing about what is in it. Bark
subscribes and swaps in place, since sinks and rules are pure data with no
OS resource attached. Two things publish today: the boot that moves a
section out of `shep.toml`, and a write from lookout's own dog config pane,
which is why an edit made there reaches a running bark without bouncing it.
A hand edit still needs the stop/start above.

**A dog that restarts itself on a config change has to say so in its own
log.** Nothing else can tell that apart from a crash loop, and the restart
count is the column an operator reads as instability.

The reason the section rides the socket instead of the environment is the
same reason it applies to every dog and not just the ones with obvious
secrets: an environment variable is readable from the process table,
inherited by every child the dog spawns, and captured into a crash dump.
`[bark.sinks]` routinely holds a webhook URL, and a webhook URL is a
bearer credential, keeping the whole section off the environment means
nobody has to remember which dog's config is sensitive.

**A section that used to live in `shep.toml` migrates to `dogs.toml`
automatically.** The first boot of a shep carrying this move reads any
`[dog.<name>]` sections still in `shep.toml`, writes them into `dogs.toml`
under their bare name, strikes them from `shep.toml`, and prints which
dogs moved. Every boot after that finds nothing to do. `shep runtime` and
`shep dev` migrate too: any boot does. If a name carries values in both
files, the daemon refuses to boot rather than guess which is right, and
`shep daemon reload` refuses before it signals the shepherd it was going
to replace. Delete one of the two sections. The likeliest way to hit that
is hand-writing `[dog.metrics]` back into `shep.toml` after it already
migrated, so check `dogs.toml` first. An empty `[dog.<name>]`, which
`shep enable` scaffolded before this move, is not a value and refuses
nothing. A dog present in only one file migrates or starts normally
either way.

## When a dog starts

Every dog starts after the flock by default, so a metrics dog does not answer
for a flock that is not up yet. Some dogs need the opposite: a log-rotation
dog has to be running before the first sheep writes a line.

`[daemon] boot_first_dogs` names the dogs that start before the muster roll is
restored rather than after it.

```toml
# $SHEP_HOME/shep.toml
[daemon]
enabled_dogs    = ["metrics", "bark", "log-rotate"]
boot_first_dogs = ["log-rotate"]
```

A name here that is not in `enabled_dogs` is inert. The list says where an
enabled dog goes, never whether it runs, so a typo or a dog you disabled later
sits in the file doing nothing and the boot says nothing about it.

The key lives in `shep.toml` and not in the dog's own `dogs.toml` section
because that section belongs to the dog. Shep hands it over the wire without
reading it, so a shep key inside it would arrive at a program that has never
heard of the key, and a third-party dog with `deny_unknown_fields` would refuse
its own config over it.

Promotion covers the boot window only. A `shep start web` typed later, while
`log-rotate` happens to be down, is a supervision problem that boot ordering
does not solve.

## The metrics dog

`shep enable metrics` serves Prometheus exposition text over plain HTTP,
bound to `127.0.0.1:9615` by default:

```toml
[metrics]
bind = "127.0.0.1:9615"
```

Nothing here accumulates between scrapes — every request rebuilds the
reading from a fresh `ListFlock` and a fresh host sample, so there is no
stale-cache window and no state a slow scraper could hold open.

| Metric | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `shep_sheep_cpu_percent` | Tree CPU as a percentage of one core, over the last sampling window. |
| `shep_sheep_memory_bytes` | Tree resident set size in bytes. |
| `shep_sheep_restart_total` | Restart count since registration. |
| `shep_sheep_uptime_seconds` | Seconds since this sheep's last successful start. |
| `shep_sheep_status` | 1 for the status this sheep is currently in, 0 for every other status. |
| `shep_dog_up` | 1 when this dog is online, 0 otherwise. |
| `shep_daemon_up` | Always 1: the scrape reached the shepherd. |
| `shep_daemon_pid` | The shepherd's own pid, so a restart is visible as a step change. |
| `shep_host_memory_total_bytes` | Total physical memory on the host. |
| `shep_host_memory_used_bytes` | Memory in use on the host, as the platform reports it. |
| `shep_host_processes` | Number of processes running on the host, the flock included. |
| `shep_host_uptime_seconds` | Seconds since the host booted. |

A reference Grafana dashboard built against this exact metric set ships
in `assets/grafana/`.

The default bind is loopback on purpose, not an oversight a wider one
would fix: every series above carries a sheep's name as a label, and on
plenty of hosts a sheep's name is the name of an internal service.
Widening `bind` to `0.0.0.0` (or any non-loopback address) is one config
line away when you want it, but the metrics dog will not make that
decision for you by shipping wide and asking you to lock it down.

## The bark dog

`shep enable bark` subscribes to the shepherd's event bus and watches for
the things worth paging someone about, delivering to named webhook sinks:

```toml
[bark.sinks]
oncall = { kind = "discord", url = "https://discord.com/api/webhooks/..." }
audit = { kind = "json", url = "https://example.internal/hook" }

[[bark.rules]]
on = "gave_up"
sinks = ["oncall", "audit"]

[[bark.rules]]
on = "restart_rate"
restarts = 5
within = "2m"
sinks = ["oncall"]
```

A sink URL cannot carry credentials. `https://user:pass@hooks.example.com/`
is refused when `dogs.toml` is read, not when a rule first fires: nothing
here sends an `Authorization` header, so the pair could only be discarded
or sent as part of a hostname. Discord and Slack put the secret in the path
instead, which is why the whole URL is a credential.

Leave `[[bark.rules]]` out entirely and the bark dog does not stay
silent — one rule is built in by default, firing on every configured sink
whenever a sheep reaches `Errored`. That is deliberate: it is the alert
that must not be missed, keyed to the shepherd's own decision that it has
given up on a sheep rather than to a threshold the bark dog chose for
itself, so it needs no opt-in.

A second restart-related rule exists and is opt-in for the opposite
reason: `restart_rate` (`N` restarts within a window) catches the early
warning — a sheep flapping but not yet `Errored` — which is exactly the
kind of thing that pages someone at 3am for a blip if an operator did not
choose the threshold themselves. Two rules, two different relationships
to configuration, because they answer two different questions: "did the
shepherd give up" needs none, "is this restarting too often for my taste"
needs yours.

Every rule debounces **per subject**, five minutes by default, never
globally — a global debounce would mean the second sheep to go down
during an incident goes silent, and that is usually the incident's most
interesting fact.

**The bus drops events under load, and the bark dog is built to survive
that rather than pretend it doesn't happen.** `tokio::sync::broadcast`
discards what a lagging subscriber cannot keep up with; on top of
listening to the bus, the bark dog polls the flock's current state on a
timer (30s by default) and evaluates the same rules against that
snapshot. A dropped frame triggers an immediate poll instead of waiting
for the next scheduled one. The two routes share one debounce record per
subject, so an `Errored` seen by both the bus and the very next poll
fires once, not twice.

Every fired alert is appended to `$SHEP_HOME/barks.jsonl`, a byte-capped
ring (1MiB by default, `history_bytes`) that evicts the oldest record
first and is the data `shep barks` reads. Two different processes append
to it — the bark dog when a rule fires, and the shepherd itself when an
enabled dog exhausts its own restart budget (below) — so it is written
through an advisory file lock, never truncated in place.

## Writing your own

Third-party extension is `shep adopt <path> [--name <name>]`:

```
shep adopt ./bin/my-watchdog --name watchdog
shep enable watchdog
shep rehome watchdog
```

`--name` is optional. Leave it off and the dog is named after its own
file stem with a leading `shep-` stripped, the way `cargo` strips
`cargo-` from its own external subcommands — `shep adopt
~/.cargo/bin/shep-log-rotate` alone names itself `log-rotate`. The path
itself can be given as-is, with a leading `~/`, or as a bare name already
on `$PATH` (which is where `cargo install`/`go install` put it).

`adopt` vets the binary once, at the moment you run it — not again at
every later boot or every `enable`. It refuses a path that does not
exist, is not a file, has no execute bit for anyone, or is world-writable
(the binary itself or its containing directory); it also refuses a name
that already belongs to a built-in verb or alias, since a dog by that
name could never be reached. It warns rather than refuses on a merely
group-writable path. Passing all of that, it actually spawns the binary
and kills it immediately, because the only honest way to know whether this
kernel can exec a file is to ask this kernel. The `--version` probe below
is that spawn, so the exec proof and the version answer cost one child
rather than two. What
gets recorded in `shep.toml` is the canonicalized, absolute path — never
whatever relative path you typed — because the daemon may resolve it
again after a reboot from a different working directory than the one
`adopt` ran from.

Once adopted, `shep <name> [args...]` runs the dog directly — the same
`git foo` runs `git-foo` precedent, resolved against adopted dogs only
(never a `$PATH` scan). It's a second invocation mode, distinct from the
one the shepherd itself uses: an adopted dog the shepherd starts gets no
argv and two environment variables (`$SHEP_HOME` and `$SHEP_DOG_NAME`,
below); a dog you name on the command line gets whatever you typed after
it, passed straight through, plus those same two. A built-in verb or alias
always wins over a same-named dog.

No argv is the adopted case specifically. The two built-in dogs are
started as `shep dog <name>` and read their own name from that argv, but
neither is a dog anybody writes: they ship inside the binary.

`rehome <name>` is `disable`'s counterpart for a third-party dog: it stops
it if running and forgets the dog entirely, rather than leaving it
disabled-but-known the way plain `disable` would. Both files: the
registration in `shep.toml`, and the dog's own `[<name>]` section in
`dogs.toml`, webhook URLs and all. `disable` keeps that section on
purpose; `rehome` is the verb that does not.

The wire a third-party dog speaks is the same client protocol
[§6](specs/shep-v1.md#6-wire-protocol-v1--protocol-version-1) pins for
every other client of this daemon: connect to the Unix socket at
`$SHEP_HOME/run/shep.sock`, send `Hello`, wait for `HelloAck`, then send
`Request::DogConfig { name }` to fetch your own `[<name>]` section as
opaque text — parse it however your own config shape wants. Shep sets two
variables of its own on a dog: `$SHEP_HOME`, which is how it finds that
socket in the first place, and `$SHEP_DOG_NAME`, which is the `name` to put
in that request. No `[<name>]` value ever rides along beside them, for
the reason given above. A section's key is not one of its values.

**Put that name in the `Hello` too, as `dog_name`.** Optional, and nothing
breaks without it right up until the shepherd is replaced by one your binary
is too old to speak to. A refused handshake never reaches a request, so the
`name` in `DogConfig` is unreadable at exactly the moment it is needed:
which dog to restart. With it, the shepherd restarts you once from the
binary on disk — which fixes the ordinary case, where the package already
replaced your file and the running process is merely old — and reports you
stale rather than looping if that restart is refused too. `shep daemon
reload` prints that report to the operator, after your reconnect rather
than before it: what the old image knew about you described a process that
was about to stop existing. Without it you go quiet and nothing on either
side says why.

A dog written against `shep-client` gets both halves from
`ReconnectingClient::connect_as_dog`, which fills the name in and also
re-establishes the connection when the shepherd is replaced. `Client` does
neither, deliberately: the CLI uses it, and a `shep stop` that silently
retried could stop a sheep twice.

That is what `shep daemon reload` asks of a dog. A dog is carried across the
reload the way a sheep is: the process is a child of a shepherd whose pid
does not change, so it keeps its own pid and its restart count stays where it
was. What does not survive is the accepted connection, which dies with the
old image — so a dog that does not dial again is a live process holding a
dead socket, alive on every column a listing has and answering nothing. The
metrics dog is measured holding its pid and `restarts 0` across six reloads
while still serving a scrape.

The bark dog is the exception, and it is on the list to fix. Its subscription
belongs to one connection, so the stream ends when that connection does and
the dog exits; autorestart replaces it, which costs one restart per reload on
a dog that is otherwise healthy. It comes back on its own every time, and its
restart budget starts a fresh window with each shepherd, so this is a count
that reads wrong rather than an outage.

Those two are what shep ADDS, not the whole environment. A dog is a
supervised process like any other, so it also starts from the small base
every sheep gets: `PATH`, plus whichever of `HOME`, `USER`, `LANG` and `TZ`
the shepherd itself has, plus `SHEP_INSTANCE`. Nothing from `[<name>]`
is in there.

**Read `$SHEP_DOG_NAME` rather than hardcoding a name.** It holds the name
you are registered under, which is the operator's `--name` if they gave one
and otherwise your own file stem with a leading `shep-` stripped. Shep sets
it every way it runs you: supervised, `shep <name>`, and the exec probe
during `adopt` itself.

Getting the name wrong is silent, which is the whole reason the variable
exists. A `DogConfig` for a name nobody adopted comes back as the empty
string, exactly what a registered dog with no section gets, because a dog
with no configuration is the ordinary case rather than a fault. So a
one-character mismatch discards the operator's entire section, uses every
default instead, and prints nothing on either side.

An absent `$SHEP_DOG_NAME` means you are not being run by a shep that sets
it. The fallback for that case: your process knows its own pid, `ListFlock`
reports a pid per entry, and the entry that is marked a dog and carries your
pid is you. `shep-log-rotate` does this, and it was the only option before
the variable existed.

**Never send `Request::Flush` as part of rotating anything.** Its name reads
like settling a buffer and it does the opposite of what a rotator wants: it
flushes what is pending and then **truncates** the recorded paths. That is
`shep flush`, an operator deliberately emptying logs, and reaching for it
before a rename on the intuition that "flush" means "make sure it is written"
deletes the lines you were about to rotate. The rename-then-`Reopen` shape
below is the one with no such hole.

There is no sandbox here, and it would be a mistake to assume one: **an
adopted dog runs at the shepherd's own trust level, with no isolation
beyond it.** That is the same trust an ordinary sheep in your Flockfile
already has, so adopting a dog does not grant anything beyond what any
process your own config already starts could do. It is an honest
comparison, not a hand-wave: you were already trusting whatever you point
a Flockfile's `script` at, and a third-party dog is held to no higher bar
than that.

## Answering `--version`

A dog answers `--version` on stdout and exits 0. Two numbers come back,
and they answer different questions:

| what | answers | on a mismatch |
|---|---|---|
| the version on line 1 | which build of the dog this is | reported |
| `shep-protocol` | whether this dog can handshake with this shepherd at all | it cannot connect until one side moves |

The format is line-oriented text:

```
shep-log-rotate 0.1.3
shep-protocol: 4
```

- Line 1 is `<name> <version>`. Shep takes the last whitespace-separated
  field as the version and ignores the name, so a crate whose name differs
  from the dog's registered name is fine. This is the line clap already
  prints for free.
- Every later line is `<key>: <value>`, one pair to a line.
  `shep-protocol` carries, in decimal, the `PROTOCOL_VERSION` the binary
  was compiled against.
- Unknown keys, blank lines, and the order of the key lines are all
  ignored. Keys beginning `shep-` are reserved, so a third number can get
  its own line later without breaking a parser that predates it. Put keys
  of your own under a prefix of your own.

Answering is optional and stays optional. Dogs predating the convention
are still adoptable, and a dog that does not answer is never refused for
it: its protocol is simply unknown.

### What `shep adopt` does with the answer

`shep adopt` asks the candidate before it records anything. The vet was
already spawning the binary to prove this kernel can exec it, so the
question costs one argument on a process that was going to start anyway.

| what the candidate answers | what `adopt` does |
|---|---|
| a `shep-protocol` this shep does not speak | refuses, before `shep.toml` is touched |
| a protocol this shep speaks | adopts, and reports the version it gave |
| a version and no protocol line | adopts, and says the protocol is unknown |
| nothing, or a run that exits non-zero | adopts, protocol unknown, no notice |

The refusal names both numbers and both ways out:

```
/usr/local/bin/shep-otel: this dog was built for shep protocol 3, and this
shep speaks 4; reinstall the dog without --locked so it builds against the
current shep-core, or run a shep that speaks 3
```

Only a stated protocol can refuse an adopt. The version is never compared
with anything, because a third-party dog's crate version has no
relationship to shep's own: `shep-log-rotate` 0.1.3 against shep 0.1.24 is
the ordinary case, not a skew, and comparing the two would report every
dog that exists.

A candidate gets one second to exit and another to have its output read,
and an adopt runs two probes, so roughly four seconds is the worst case. Its
process group is killed either way, so a dog that ignores both flags and
runs costs that time and is adopted with an unknown protocol. It cannot
hang the `adopt` that is vetting it.

None of the answer is written down. `[daemon] adopted_dogs` records the
path and nothing else, and a protocol stored at adopt time would be a copy
of a number that can change on disk with nothing watching. That is G12's
row 5, the one case where the stored copy would be wrong exactly when it
mattered, so the binary is asked again rather than remembered.

A dog written against `shep-client` answers this probe and the schema one
below with a single call, as the first line of `main`:

```rust
fn main() {
    shep_client::dogs::probe::<MyDogConfig>(
        env!("CARGO_PKG_NAME"),
        env!("CARGO_PKG_VERSION"),
    );
    // ...normal startup, reached only when this run is not a probe.
}
```

It prints the answer and exits when shep asked a question, and returns when
it did not, so nothing after it runs on a probe: put it before anything has
been opened. The name and the version are arguments because `env!` expands
where it is written, and they are the two facts only the dog knows. The flag
names, the `shep-protocol` key and the number it carries all come from shep,
which is the point of the call: they were hand-typed from this page until it
existed, and a typo in any of them read as "protocol unknown" with nothing
saying so.

Lines rather than JSON, because a human runs `--version` far more often
than shep does, and because a stranger writing a dog in a language shep
has never seen gets two `printf` calls right on the first try. Hand
written JSON is where the quoting and the trailing comma go wrong, and
nothing here nests.

### What `shep restart <dog>` does with the answer

`cargo install` replaces a file and never touches a process, so a dog
upgraded on disk leaves a working system: the dog running now is the old
binary, still connected, still doing its job. The two only meet at the next
restart, which may be days away and for a reason that has nothing to do with
the upgrade.

`shep restart <name>` is that restart, so it asks the same question first:

```
notice[dog_binary_skew]: `log-rotate`'s binary at /usr/local/bin/shep-log-rotate
was built for shep protocol 5, and this shep speaks 4; restarting it brings it
back on that binary, unable to connect. Run a shep that speaks 5, or reinstall
the dog against protocol 4, and restart it again
```

Then it restarts the dog. This is a warning and never a refusal: the
operator asked for the restart, the binary on disk may be exactly what they
just installed, and there are two ways out of the state rather than one, so
the message names both and picks neither.

| what the binary answers | what `restart` does |
|---|---|
| a `shep-protocol` this shep does not speak | warns, then restarts |
| a protocol this shep speaks | restarts, silently |
| a version and no protocol line | restarts, silently |
| nothing, or a run that exits non-zero | restarts, silently |

**Unknown is not stale.** Every dog written before this contract is in the
last two rows, and a line on stderr for each of them is how an operator
learns to skip the one that matters.

Three things are never asked at all. A built-in dog has no binary of its
own, so there is nothing to be stale. A selector that sweeps rather than
names, `all` or a `/regex/`, does not reach a dog in the first place. And a
dog named by id rather than by name is restarted without a check, because
looking up its name would cost a round trip before the restart the operator
asked for.

The cost is the same second `adopt` spends, and it is paid only by a restart
that named an adopted dog. A binary that hangs is killed when the second is
up and the restart goes ahead unwarned, so the slowest a dog can make
`shep restart` is two seconds, never indefinitely. Two rather than one
because the wait for the process to exit and the wait for its text are
bounded separately: a grandchild holding the pipe open can cost the second
budget after a clean exit.

A named restart can briefly run your dog twice. To read the binary on disk,
shep runs it with `--version`, and a dog that does not RECOGNISE that flag
ignores it and starts doing its ordinary job instead, with `SHEP_HOME`
pointing at the live shepherd. So a rotator can rotate once and a bark dog
can open a second subscription, for up to the budget above, before the
process and everything it forked are killed.

Only dogs that ignore the flag are affected. A dog that recognises
`--version` and exits, even without naming a protocol, does no work: its
protocol is unknown and nothing overlaps. The trade is
deliberate: the command is about to restart that dog anyway, so the only
question is whether it briefly overlaps itself, and the alternative is not
asking at all, which is what let a stale dog sit `online` unnoticed. Adding
`--version` to your dog removes the overlap, since a dog that answers exits
immediately.


### Why the binary is the only thing that can answer

A dog's crate version does not imply its protocol, and neither does
knowing that somebody installed it:

| how the dog was built | which `shep-core` | so which protocol |
|---|---|---|
| `cargo install <dog>` | re-resolved, newest compatible | current |
| `cargo install --locked`, and most CI | whatever the shipped lockfile pins | whatever was pinned on publish day |

Measured 2026-08-31: `shep-log-rotate` 0.1.3 installed plain compiled
`shep-core` 0.1.24, so the packaged lockfile was ignored, while the same
crate built `--locked` produced a protocol 1 dog. Both published dogs
were shipping a lockfile pinning a protocol 1 `shep-core` that day, and
both repositories' CI had been red on it for two days. The crate version
was identical either way. That is the whole argument for asking the
binary: nothing outside it knows.

### The built-in dogs are outside this

`metrics` and `bark` are not separate binaries. The shepherd starts them
as `<its own binary> dog <name>`, so a built-in dog **is** the shep
binary that spawned it and cannot skew from it on disk. There is no
question here for a contract to answer:

```
$ shep --version
shep 0.1.24
$ shep dog metrics --version
shep-dog 0.1.24
```

Neither prints a `shep-protocol` line, and that is not a gap to close.
The protocol a built-in dog speaks is the shepherd's own, because it is
the shepherd's binary.

### What this does not catch

Two dogs can agree on the protocol and still be different code.
`RpcError` gained a public `daemon_version` field inside the 0.1.x range;
its fields are public and it has no constructor, so every literal built
outside `shep-client` stopped compiling while `PROTOCOL_VERSION` stood
still. Protocol equality is necessary and not sufficient.

Closing that is deferred, and the reason is that `--version` cannot close
it. A break of that kind is source level: it lands when the dog is
compiled, in the dog's own repository, and a dog nobody rebuilt keeps
running. Shep has no table of which `shep-client` versions build against
which daemon, and a version comparison standing in for one would report
dogs that are fine. What catches it is the dog's own CI building against
a current `shep-core`, which is where both published dogs' breakage was
already visible and unread.

## Answering `--schema`

`shep adopt` asks a second question straight after the first: `--schema`,
answered on stdout with a JSON Schema for the dog's own `[<name>]` section.
Same shape as `--version` and the same budget: spawn, read, kill.

Asked of the binary rather than over the socket, because the dog most in
need of configuring is the one that is disabled or has never started, and it
has no connection to answer on. Configure then enable is the order an
operator wants.

`probe` answers this flag too, from its type parameter. Derive `JsonSchema`
and `DogConfig` on the type the dog deserializes its config into, and mark
every field holding a credential:

```rust
use shep_client::dogs::DogConfig;

#[derive(Default, serde::Deserialize, schemars::JsonSchema, DogConfig)]
#[serde(deny_unknown_fields, default)]
struct MyDogConfig {
    /// Where to POST. Doc comments become the schema's descriptions.
    #[shep(secret)]
    webhook: String,
    /// What to watch.
    path: String,
}
```

`#[shep(secret)]` says the field is a bearer credential, and shep renders
one as `<set>`: replaceable, never read back. The attribute exists rather
than the schemars extension it expands to because that extension key is a
string the author types, and a transposed letter in it compiles, validates,
marks nothing, and paints the credential on screen. Marking a field the
schema does not have, which is what a `#[serde(rename)]` on it produces, is
a refusal rather than a silent pass.

**A mark names a field of the type shep asked about.** A credential one type
down, in a nested struct or in a map's values, is not covered by a mark down
there: mark the field that holds them. Bark's own `sinks` map is marked
whole for this reason, and every sink in it carries a webhook URL.

**Answering is optional, exactly as `--version` is.** A dog that says
nothing is adopted, recorded as having no schema, and refused nothing, which
is every dog written before this contract. What it gives up is the pane
below: with no schema to render a form from, its section stays a file an
operator hand-edits. Nothing else changes.

## What a schema buys: the settings pane

`s` in `shep lookout`, then `e` on the dog's row, opens a form over its
`[<name>]` section. One row per property, the value the section sets beside
it, `(unset)` where it sets none, and `<set>` where a field is marked as a
credential. A property the schema gives a default still reads `(unset)`: the
pane shows the file, not the dog's own fallback. It writes as well, behind
`--allow-control`, and it writes the section whole, so the comments in
`dogs.toml` survive an edit shep made.

The pane is flat, with no section headers, and its cost column is empty on
every row. shep does not know what a dog's field costs; the dog does. The
foot of the pane says so once, naming the dog, rather than guessing per
row:

```
shep publishes the change; bark decides what to reload
```

A dog that publishes no schema gets no pane, and a line saying where its
settings do live:

```
pydog publishes no schema; edit dogs.toml with $EDITOR
```

The schema is asked for again when the pane opens rather than cached from
adopt time, so the dog does not have to be running. Configure then enable is
the order an operator wants, and it works.

**Asking runs it.** Opening the pane on an adopted dog spawns that binary
with `--schema`, waits a second for an answer, then kills its whole process
group, on the same terms `shep adopt` asks on. The group is what catches a
dog that forks a worker before answering. A descendant that calls `setsid`
leaves the group and survives it, and on Windows there is no group, so only
the probe itself is killed. That is a third party's code executing because
somebody pressed a key, so it is worth knowing before browsing the config of
a dog you did not write. A built-in dog is shep's own binary and is never
spawned.

A dog that answers something that is not JSON gets one line, and is adopted
anyway:

```
notice[dog_schema_unreadable]: pydog answered `--schema` with something that
is not JSON, so shep has no description of its settings and they stay a
hand-edited section. The dog is adopted and runs normally; this is a bug to
report to whoever wrote it
```

Silence earns no such line, for the reason an unstated protocol earns none:
it is the ordinary case, and a notice for every dog is how an operator
learns to skip the one that matters.

**The answer is not written down**, on the same rule the protocol number
follows. `cargo install` replaces a binary with nothing watching, and a
stale schema is worse than a stale version number, because it mislabels
which field is a credential. Shep asks the binary again when it needs one.

## What shep writes into a dog's own log

A dog's log is the first place anyone looks when a dog misbehaves, and
until recently it held only what the dog itself said. Everything shep had
to say about it — the spawn, the handshake, the verdict — went to
`shepd.err.log`, which is not the file shep's own error messages tell you
to open.

Shep now writes its own account into the dog's log as well, marked
`[shep]` so it cannot be mistaken for the dog's output:

```
2026-09-02T14:22:31.412+02:00 [shep] shep started this dog; its process is pid 5512
2026-09-02T14:22:31.480+02:00 [shep] shep accepted this dog's handshake; it is registered with this shepherd as `log-rotate`, on protocol 4
2026-09-02T14:22:31.492+02:00 rotating web-0-out.log (12.4 MiB)
```

Six things get written: the spawn and the resolved binary path, an
accepted handshake (once, the first time this shepherd hears from the
dog — not on every reconnect), a refused handshake with both protocol
numbers, the warning when a dog has gone quiet, the verdict when shep
gives up on it, and the exit code or signal when its process stops.

`shep bleats <name> --follow` sees the same lines live, marked the same
way, interleaved with the dog's own output in arrival order.

## When a dog stops answering

A dog that is running but never handshakes gets one restart from disk and
then a verdict. That verdict now says what the shepherd actually watched
happen, because the three cases it could not previously tell apart have
opposite fixes:

- **Nothing has ever connected from the dog's process.** The dog is not
  reaching the socket. Rebuild or reinstall it.
- **Its process has connected, and never named a dog in its handshake.**
  The dog is talking to shep and may be serving every request it is
  asked; what it does not do is say who it is. Reinstalling the same
  build will not change that — it is built against shep-client older than
  0.1.23, or it calls `Client::connect` where it should call
  `ReconnectingClient::connect_as_dog`. Rebuild it against a current
  shep-client.
- **Shep could not tell which process opened the connections.** Windows
  has no peer identity by design, and some unix platforms decline to
  report a pid. Neither of the two above is ruled out, so shep names both
  and tells you to read the dog's own log, where a dog that cannot reach
  the socket says so and one that is merely anonymous does not.

Every one of them ends with a command to run.

## When a dog dies

If an enabled dog exhausts its own restart budget and lands on `Errored`,
the shepherd writes a record of that straight into `barks.jsonl` itself,
independent of whether the bark dog is even running. This matters for one
specific reason: the bark dog has no webhook code of its own for
reporting its own death, by design, so if the bark dog is the one that
died, nothing is going to page anyone about it over Discord or Slack.
What you get instead is a local record — `shep barks` after the fact
shows the moment alerting stopped rather than leaving a gap you have to
infer — and the metrics dog's `shep_dog_up` gauge dropping to `0` for
that dog's name, visible to anything already scraping it.

Nothing watches across dogs, and that absence is not an oversight: the
supervisor that restarts a crashed dog has no idea what a "dog" is beyond
the marker on its entry, by design, so a dog cannot be supervised
differently than a sheep, and no dog is positioned to watch another dog
the way the shepherd watches all of them. If you want to know a dog went
down, `shep barks` and the metrics endpoint are the two places that say
so — nothing pushes it further than that on its own.
