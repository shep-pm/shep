"""Refuse an intra-workspace dev-dependency that carries a version.

`cargo publish` keeps a dev-dependency that has a version and has to resolve
it; one without a version is dropped. A version on an intra-workspace
dev-dependency is therefore a publish-order constraint: when crate B depends
on crate A normally and A dev-depends on B with a version, neither can publish
first. `workspace = true` inherits the version without looking like it does.
Write such an entry inline, with a path and no version:

    shep-client = { path = "../shep-client" }

Exits 0 when every intra-workspace dev-dependency is path-only, 1 otherwise.
