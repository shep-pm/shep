//! Traps `SIGTERM` and refuses to die, so `kill_timeout` elapses and
//! shep escalates to `SIGKILL`. `graceful_timeout` governs a reload's
//! drain window for the old instance. `kill_timeout` is the grace
//! period between a stop signal and `SIGKILL`, set below in
//! `examples/Flockfile.toml`.
//!
//! Stop this one with `shep stop` to watch `kill_timeout` expire and
//! `SIGKILL` follow.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! ```text
//! stubborn
//! ```
//!
//! Unix only. On any other platform this prints why and exits 1:
//! there is no signal to trap.
