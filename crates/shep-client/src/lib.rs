//! Async client for the shep daemon: connect-or-spawn state machine, typed
//! wrappers for every RPC verb, and event-bus subscription streams. This is

//! Re-exports [`shep_core`] so downstream users need a single dependency.
//!
//! # Quick start
//! ```
//! use shep_client::shep_core::prelude::MemSize;
//!
//! let limit: MemSize = "512M".parse().unwrap();
//! assert_eq!(limit.bytes(), 512 << 20);
//! ```
