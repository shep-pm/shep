//! [`ReconnectingClient`]: a connection that re-establishes itself when the daemon on the other end is replaced.

//! A handover carries the listening socket across `execve` but not an accepted
//! one, so a dog's own process survives holding a dead socket. [`Client`] has
//! no such mode: the CLI's one-shot verbs must never see a request silently
//! retried, so in-flight requests here fail too, and only the connection
//! re-establishes. A background task reconnects as soon as the connection
//! dies rather than on the next request, so an idle dog still re-handshakes
//! before `shep daemon reload` polls dog staleness, and a refusing successor
//! stops the supervisor ([`LinkState::Refused`]) rather than retrying.
//! [`ReconnectingClient::connect_as_dog`] names the dog on every handshake so
//! a refusal is actionable.
