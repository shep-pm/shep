//! The dog side of the probe contract: one call a dog makes as its first
//! line, which answers every question shep asks its binary.
//!
//! A dog is a plugin process the shepherd supervises. Before shep adopts one,
//! and again whenever it needs the dog's config schema, it spawns the binary
//! with a flag and reads what comes back. [`probe`] answers both flags, so
//! neither the answer's format nor the flag names are ever typed by a dog
//! author:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! # #[cfg_attr(feature = "schema", derive(schemars::JsonSchema))]
//! # #[derive(shep_client::dogs::DogConfig)]
//! # struct MyDogConfig {}
//! fn main() {
//!     shep_client::dogs::probe::<MyDogConfig>(
//!         env!("CARGO_PKG_NAME"),
//!         env!("CARGO_PKG_VERSION"),
//!     );
//!     // ...normal startup, reached only when this run is not a probe.
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! `name` and `version` are arguments rather than `env!` calls in this
//! crate, since `env!` expands where it is written and would report
//! `shep-client`'s own version instead of the dog's.
//!
//! Answering is optional: with the `schema` feature off, [`probe`] still
//! answers the version flag, and the schema flag exits without printing,
//! which shep reads as a dog with no schema and refuses nothing for.
