//! The `DogConfig` derive, and nothing else.
//!
//! A dog publishes a JSON Schema for its config so shep can render a
//! settings pane. One field kind needs marking: a credential, shown
//! as `<set>` rather than its value. `schemars` can mark that by hand
//! with `#[schemars(extend("x-shep-secret" = true))]`. But the key is
//! a string an author can misspell silently. This derive turns that
//! into a compile error.
//!
//! Depend on `shep-client`, not this crate: it re-exports the derive
//! next to the `DogConfig` trait it implements.

/// use shep_client::dogs::DogConfig;
///
/// #[derive(serde::Deserialize, schemars::JsonSchema, DogConfig)]
/// #[serde(tag = "kind", rename_all = "snake_case")]
/// enum Sink {

///         url: String,
///     },
/// }
///
/// // One name, not two: see below.
/// assert_eq!(Sink::SECRET_FIELDS, ["url"]);
/// ```
///
/// That example runs, which needs `shep-client` as a dev-dependency
/// of this crate. A cycle on paper, allowed since dev-dependencies
/// sit outside the library build graph. The derive's behaviour is
/// tested in `shep-client`, where the marking happens.
///
/// # What it expands to
///
/// An `impl shep_client::dogs::DogConfig`, carrying the names of the marked
/// fields and the extension key that marks them. The key comes from
/// `shep_core::dogs::SECRET_KEY` by way of `shep_client`'s re-export.
/// It is never spelled out here or in the dog:
///
/// ```rust,ignore
/// impl ::shep_client::dogs::DogConfig for Sink {
///     const SECRET_KEY: &'static str = ::shep_client::dogs::SECRET_KEY;
///     const SECRET_FIELDS: &'static [&'static str] = &["url"];
/// }
/// ```
///
/// One `"url"`, not two, for the two variants above. The list is
/// names, and a name repeated across variants is one name.
/// `schemars` builds a `oneOf`, one object per variant with its own
/// `properties`, for a tagged enum. A mark has to reach every
/// occurrence of the name, not a single top-level property.
///
/// # Renames
///
/// A field is named here by its Rust identifier. A
/// `#[serde(rename)]` on a marked field changes what the schema
/// calls it. The marker would then have no property to land on.
/// That is caught where the marking happens, in `shep_client`. It
/// refuses a name it cannot find rather than passing an unmarked
/// credential on.
///
/// A `#[serde(rename_all)]` on a tagged enum renames the variants,
/// not their fields, so a `url` inside one stays `url`.
///
/// # Compile errors
///
/// Deliberate refusals, each with its own message:
///
/// - `#[shep(secret)]` on an unnamed field (tuple struct or variant),
///   with no schema property to mark;
/// - `#[shep(...)]` on the type or on a variant, neither of which is a field;
/// - a union, which has no serde representation to build a schema from;
/// - `#[shep]` with no option in parentheses;
/// - `#[shep(secret = ...)]`, since `secret` is a flag and takes no value;
/// - any option other than `secret`, rejected as a likely misspelling of it.
///
/// A struct or variant with no fields, an unmarked tuple, and a
/// unit-variant enum are accepted and carry no marks. A dog whose config
/// holds no credential still wants the impl.
