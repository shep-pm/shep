//! The dog contract: what a dog is spawned as, and how it is served its own
//! configuration
//!
//! A dog is an ordinary supervised process that speaks the control protocol.
//! [`dog_app`] assembles the same [`ResolvedApp`] a Flockfile entry would, and
//! the supervisor supervises it as a sheep. Both [`DogSpec::source`] kinds run
//! at the daemon's own trust level.
//!
//! Configuration travels over the socket through [`dog_section`]: a dog
//! inherits `$SHEP_HOME` and `$SHEP_DOG_NAME`, then asks for its `[<name>]`
//! section of `dogs.toml`. No section value reaches the child's environment,
//! which is readable from the process table and inherited by every child.
