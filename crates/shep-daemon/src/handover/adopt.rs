//! Every descriptor named here crossed an `execve`: the predecessor cleared
//! `FD_CLOEXEC` on it (see [`super::fds`]) and wrote its number into the
//! blob. Nothing here opens a file, binds a socket or creates a pipe.
//! `O_APPEND` and the pidfile's `flock` are properties of the open file
//! description, so wrapping keeps both: reopening a log would leave a
//! `copytruncate` rotator a sparse hole, and re-acquiring the lock would open
//! a window for a second daemon to win this home. A descriptor the blob names
//! and the process does not have refuses the whole rehydrate. The pidfile is
//! adopted last, so an earlier refusal leaves it open, unowned, and locked.
