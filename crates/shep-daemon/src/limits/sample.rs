//! The [`MemorySampler`] seam: one read of the machine's process table, and
//! the pure sum that turns it into one sheep's tree total.
//!
//! [`SysinfoSampler`] is the real implementation. A `ScriptedSampler` test
//! fixture replays a scripted sequence of readings for tests that need the
//! table to change between polls. [`tree_rss`] is the pure function both
//! feed; see [`limits`](crate::limits) for why the sum spans the whole
//! process tree.
//!
//! Every item here is public so the bench crate and

//! [`SysinfoSampler`] and [`MemorySampler`] from outside this crate.
