//! The supervisor actor: owns the flock's lifecycle state machine.
//!
//! [`spawn_supervisor`] starts the actor task and hands back a
//! [`SupervisorHandle`]. Every registered instance ("sheep") gets its own task
//! owning the live `(proc, ProcIo)` pair; the actor holds one lifecycle entry
//! plus two senders per id, so the loop never awaits process I/O. However a
//! sheep ends, it reaches the actor as exactly one `Msg::Exited`.
//!
//! `stop`/`restart`/`delete` and `shutdown` resolve their selector up front,
//! then answer once every matched sheep is terminal.
