//! Portable RPC dispatch: verb routing, typed errors, per-call deadlines
//!
//! `dispatch` is the one function the connection layer calls per request
//! envelope. Everything here compiles and tests on every platform: no
//! `cfg(unix)`, no sockets, no bytes on a wire. [`RpcContext`] bundles the
//! daemon-wide handles a request handler may touch; `Outcome` tells the
//! caller what to do next (reply, forward bus events, or begin shutdown).
//!
//! Every envelope gets a `budget`: its own `deadline_ms`, clamped to
//! `MAX_DEADLINE_MS` so a peer cannot pin a daemon task open, or
//! `DEFAULT_DEADLINE_MS` when it sent none.
