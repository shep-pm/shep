//! The filesystem-watch subsystem (spec §4).
//!
//! [`source`] bridges notify's debounced events onto a tokio channel.
//! [`WatchFilter`] decides which delivered paths trigger a restart, and
//! [`spawn_watch_group`] runs one name-group's restart loop over them,
//! single-flighted like [`crate::cron`]'s.
//!
//! A triggering change restarts every instance of the name, stopped ones
//! included: disarming a sheep's watch, not filtering the restart, is what
//! keeps it down. A rescan bypasses both glob sets and always restarts.
//! `watch = true` requires `cwd`; the debounce runs on notify's own OS
//! thread, so a paused clock in tests never moves it.
