//! The muster roll: persisted flock state for restart-survival (`shep muster`)
//!
//! `FlockRegistry::roll` turns the registry's [`AppConfig`]s plus a live
//! [`ProcessInfo`] listing into a [`FlockSnapshot`], written to `flock.json`
//! by `write_atomic`. A `SnapshotWriter` task debounces lifecycle events so a
//! restart storm produces one write. `restorable` re-validates every entry,
//! since the file is human-editable.
//!
//! `muster` reads the roll and starts those apps, from `boot` and from the
//! `Muster` request alike. An app restores iff it was running when the roll was
//! saved (`instances_running > 0`) and `autostart` is still true; one the flock
//! already has is left where it stands, still reported as restored.
