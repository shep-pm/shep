//! `dogs.toml` keep using this one, imported back in through a

//! Deliberately not consolidated with [`crate::overrides`]'s own
//! `OverridesLock`, which is the same `flock(2)`/`share_mode(0)` shape
//! against a different lock file. The two crates that hold a [`ConfigLock`]
//! already agree on its ordering (`shep.toml` outer, `dogs.toml` inner, per
//! `dog_migration.rs`'s own header), and unifying the two lock types is a
//! separate, later change.

/// `shep-cli`'s `ShepToml::edit` takes one over `shep.toml`, and
/// `commands::dog_migration` takes one over `dogs.toml`, which has two
/// writers of its own. Whenever both are held at once, `shep.toml`'s is
/// taken first, which is the whole of what keeps the two orderings from
/// deadlocking; `migrate_dog_sections` is the one caller that holds both,
/// and it says so at the point it nests them.
///
/// The lock is on a sibling `<name>.lock`, never on the config itself,
/// and that is the whole design decision, the same one `barks::RingLock`
/// records: `ShepToml::save` finishes by `rename`ing a new file over the
/// config, which replaces the inode. A lock taken on the config would be a
/// lock on an inode the very next successful save unlinks; the next writer
/// would open the *new* inode, find it unlocked, and the two would be
/// excluding nothing. The lock file is never renamed, never rewritten and
/// never read; it exists only to be an inode with a stable identity, and
/// it is left on disk between edits on purpose so both writers keep
/// agreeing on which one it is.
