//! shep's control plane is a length-delimited framed byte stream: an
//! `AF_UNIX` socket on unix, a named pipe on Windows. The only module
//! naming an OS transport type; everything above carries no `cfg`.
//!
//! The address is a [`Path`], but the Windows pipe name is only
//! path-*shaped*: never take its `parent()` or ask `exists()`.

//! Security: unix relies on `0700` on `$SHEP_HOME/run` plus a same-uid
//! `peer_cred` check; Windows relies on the pipe's ACL, which grants
//! `Everyone` read but not write (canonical writeup: shep-daemon's `RpcServer`).
