//! The client<->daemon wire protocol (version 4)
//!
//! Typed request/response enums plus bus events. Framing lives in [`wire`];
//! every type here is snapshot-pinned, so changing a serialized shape bumps
//! [`PROTOCOL_VERSION`].
//!
//! Version 4 bumped on an addition, against the rule below. An older daemon
//! cannot decode the new config requests, so the handshake must catch the
//! skew.
//!
//! Two test-name conventions assert opposite things: a `*_wire_v4` snapshot
//! pins the shape this crate serializes today, so it follows
//! [`PROTOCOL_VERSION`] and gets renamed when that moves; a
//! `v1_*_fixture_still_deserializes` test pins a literal payload from an old
//! peer, and its name must never move since it records where the bytes
//! came from.
