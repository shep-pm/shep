//!
//! One [`Bark`] per line, appended by the bark dog on a rule fire and by
//! the shepherd on a dog's exhausted restart budget, and read by `shep
//! barks`. [`append`] evicts oldest-first under a byte cap by rewriting
//! survivors to a temp file and `rename`ing it over the original, so a
//! writer that dies mid-rewrite never leaves a fragment. [`read`] skips
//! any unparseable line, since this file is read during an incident.
//!
//! The two writers are separate OS processes, so a [`crate::file_lock`] on
//! a sibling `<path>.lock` serializes them; shep-core, not shep-daemon, is
//! where that lock belongs.
