//! No I/O, no terminal types, no clock. [`App::update`] is synchronous, work
//! for the outside comes back as an [`Effect`] the caller runs, and every
//! `Instant` arrives on a message.
//!
//! The bus is lossy, so [`Msg::Event`] upserts and [`Msg::Snapshot`] replaces
//! the whole flock map. The cursor is a [`RowKey`], not a row index: the map is
//! replaced wholesale every two seconds, and [`App::reseat`] puts the cursor
//! back on a real row.
