//! The lookout's state and its reducer: `Msg` in, `Effect` out.
//!
//! No I/O, no terminal types, no clock. [`App::update`] is synchronous, work
//! for the outside comes back as an [`Effect`] the caller runs, and every
//! `Instant` arrives on a message.
//!
//! The bus is lossy, so [`Msg::Event`] upserts and [`Msg::Snapshot`] replaces
//! the whole flock map. The cursor is a [`RowKey`], not a row index: the map is
//! replaced wholesale every two seconds, and [`App::reseat`] puts the cursor
//! back on a real row.
//!
//! [`App`] and [`Body`] are declared here; everything that reads or changes
//! them is a sibling module, one per screen or per subject, each with its own
//! tests:
//!
//! - [`msg`] and [`rows`] are the vocabulary: what arrives, what departs, and
//!   the small value types both sides name.
//! - [`update`] is the reducer, [`keys`] the fork every keypress goes through,
//!   and [`read`] what the renderer reads back.
//! - [`selection`] owns which rows are visible and where the cursor sits;
//!   [`samples`] the sparkline series; [`lambs`] the walk under one sheep.
//! - [`action`] is the one armed verb, and [`close_dialog`] the one a pane
//!   raises on its way out.
//! - A screen apiece: [`settings`], [`secrets_pane`], [`config_pane`],
//!   [`sheep_pane`], [`bleats`], [`dog_pane`], and the sub-screens in
//!   [`pane_list`].
