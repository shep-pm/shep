//! `shep lookout` (alias `dash`): the terminal dashboard.
//!
//! Four panes, one screen: the flock table, a sheep detail pane
//! ([`view::detail`]) and a bleats feed ([`view::bleats`]) under the selected
//! row, and a host-usage strip ([`view::host`]) above. A narrow or short
//! terminal drops panes before columns; [`view::panes_for`] is the tier table.

//! Two tasks: the link task ([`link::run_link`]) owns the connection, the UI

//! Neither borrows the other. A dead shepherd freezes the dashboard rather
