//!
//! A crash that leaves raw mode on and the alternate screen entered leaves
//! the operator with no echo, no line editing and no visible cursor.
//!
//! Two mechanisms cover it: [`install_panic_hook`] restores before calling
//! the previous hook, and [`RestoreGuard`]'s `Drop` covers every `?`, early
//! return and a panic's own unwind, except under `panic = "abort"`, which
//! this workspace does not set. [`restore`] is idempotent, since a panic
//! fires both. Nothing that can panic runs between the hook and raw mode:
//! hook, then raw mode, then the screen.
