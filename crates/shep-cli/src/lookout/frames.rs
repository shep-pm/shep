===================

These are real frames, rendered headlessly through ratatui's TestBackend by

    cargo test -p shep --lib --all-features -- --ignored write_the_gallery

Nothing here is a mockup.

frames.ansi is the same thirty-three frames with colour; read it with `less -R`.

All four panes are here: the flock table (the spine), the host-usage strip,
the sheep detail pane and the bleats feed. The selected sheep's row is
painted (see frames.ansi for the colour; frames.txt carries none, so the
row reads as a blank gutter there) rather than marked with `>`, which is
only the fallback for a terminal with no ground to paint with. Every pane
below the table describes that one sheep.

The feed reads the selected sheep's log files from disk and re-reads them with
each flock listing. It is not a live subscription, and it says so on its own
header line: `out then err` because the two files are shown end to end with no
interleaving, and `re-read with each listing` because a two-second gap in this
pane is the refresh, not the sheep.

When the pane cannot show everything, the header says what went instead. Lines
it read and dropped are counted exactly; bytes below its 64 KiB window were
never read at all, so those are reported in bytes, because nothing counted the
lines in them and guessing would be worse than saying so.

The last seven frames are the settings screen, `s` from the dashboard. It owns
the whole body between the title and the status bar rather than sharing it
with the flock table, so a fresh $SHEP_HOME, some scalars declared, an armed
confirm, the socket editor mid-type, the dogs table's own drift, the same
screen at 45 columns and the same screen too short to hold every row each get
a frame of their own.
