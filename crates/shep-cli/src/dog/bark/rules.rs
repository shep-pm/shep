//! What makes a bark fire: [`Rule`], [`Trigger`] and the [`Rules`] engine
//! that turns a bus event or a reconciliation poll into zero or more
//! [`Firing`]s.
//!
//! [`Rules::on_poll`] catches what the bus drops: it evaluates the same
//! rules against the flock's current state instead of one event. Both
//! routes share one per-subject debounce in [`Rules`]'s `subjects` map, so
//! a rule fired by one route is not fired again by the other.
//!
//! Debounce is per rule per subject, never global: a global debounce would
//! silence the second sheep to go down during an incident.
