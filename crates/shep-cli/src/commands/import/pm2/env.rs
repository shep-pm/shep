//! Splitting a dump row's environment into what a Flockfile should carry and

//! pm2 flattens the shell that ran `pm2 start` into every row's `env` map
//! alongside whatever the ecosystem file declared. The `env_<name>` maps are
//! the one place that flattening never reaches, so [`split`] treats their
//! union as the declared env. Everything else in `env` is checked against
//! [`SESSION_SHELL`] and [`PM2_INJECTED`], two closed lists. Do not grow
//! either by guessing: too long loses data silently, too short costs one
//! line of output.
