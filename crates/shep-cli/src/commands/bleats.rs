//! `bleats` (alias `logs`): following a sheep's log stream. The only
//! streaming verb, and the only one whose output skips
//! [`crate::output`]'s envelope: a follow has no end, so there is nothing
//! to wrap.
//!
//! One `Request::ListFlock` resolves an id -> [`ProcessInfo`] cache before
//! subscribing, since the daemon's topic filter carries no sheep identity:
//! selector filtering happens client-side against that cache.
//!
//! `--no-follow` never subscribes: it tails each matched sheep's log files
//! and exits. `--follow` prints that same tail first, then subscribes.
