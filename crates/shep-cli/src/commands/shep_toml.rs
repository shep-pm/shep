//! `$SHEP_HOME/shep.toml`, the daemon's own config file, read and rewritten
//! by [`ShepToml`], the one writer this binary has for it.

//! Edits go through `toml_edit`'s [`DocumentMut`], so an operator's comments

//! `shep.toml.lock` across the read-modify-write, and the document staged
//! `0600`, `fsync`ed and `rename`d. A `try_edit` closure's own `Err` leaves
//! `path` untouched.

// Fires only on Windows: `ShepTomlError` crosses the lint's 128-byte
