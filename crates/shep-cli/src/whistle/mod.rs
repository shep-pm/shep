//! `shep whistle`: the MCP interface, over stdio.
//!
//! stdout is the transport: a single stray byte on it corrupts the JSON-RPC
//! stream, so this verb takes only a stderr handle, never `output::emit`,
//! and installs no tracing subscriber.
//!
//! The peer is the launcher: whistle binds no port, listens on no socket,
//! and has nobody to authenticate. Whoever launched it already runs as
//! this uid and can already run `shep stop`. See [`gate`] for what the
//! control gate is, and is not.
//!
//! `catalogue` (`#[cfg(test)]` only) renders `docs/whistle/tools.md`.
