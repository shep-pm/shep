/*
 * Landing-page lexicon signposts — the six terms featured in the "Fifteen
 * words carry the whole product" section (docs/shep-design/README.md,
 * "Screens > 1. Landing page > Lexicon").
 *
 * Source of truth: docs/terminology.md. That file's table is not uniformly
 * structured for card rendering — some "Where it applies" cells are one
 * clean CLI example (`shep flock` (list)), others run a paragraph of
 * caveats (the "a sheep" row) — so the term / meaning / CLI line below are
 * hand-curated prose, not a mechanical parse. What IS mechanical: the check
 * below reads terminology.md at build time and fails the build if any of
 * these six terms has been renamed or dropped from the approved lexicon, so
 * a rename in that file can't silently leave this page out of sync.
 *
 * Card styling (bg/fg/tilt) is presentational, not sourced from a doc —
 * verbatim from design-files/Shep Landing v3 scene.dc.html's `signs` array.

// bundles this module somewhere else on disk (its import.meta.url no
// longer points at web/src/data/, so a relative fs read 404s at build
// time even though it works fine under `astro dev`).
