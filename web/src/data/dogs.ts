/*
 * The community dog index.
 *
 * `web/public/dogs.json` is the single source. It lives in `public/`, not
 * here in `src/data/`, because it has a second consumer this module cannot
 * satisfy: the published site serves it verbatim at `/dogs.json`, a stable
 * URL `shep dogs --available` reads (`crates/shep-cli/src/dog_index.rs`).
 * Every other data file on this site is a TypeScript module because only
 * the site itself reads it; this one has to be plain JSON so something
 * outside the Astro build can too.
 *
 * The file is an object, `{ "$schema": ..., "version": 1, "dogs": [...] }`,
 * not a bare top-level array of entries -- `unwrapIndex()` below is what
 * peels that open before `validate()` ever sees an entry, and it is a
 * breaking change against `shep` 0.1.0, which read the old bare-array shape
 * and nothing else. `$schema` gives a contributor's editor completion when
 * they add a row; a bare array could never carry that, or `version` beside
 * it. `version` is what lets a future, incompatible reshape of the wrapper
 * announce itself instead of silently parsing wrong -- `dog_index.rs`'s own
 * module doc has the fuller reasoning, shared by both readers of this file.
 *
 * This module is the gate: it validates that JSON at import time and throws
 * on the first bad entry, which fails `astro build` with the thrown message
 * printed. A malformed `dogs.json` cannot ship, in dev or in CI, without
 * anyone adding tooling for it. `web/public/dogs.schema.json` is a second,
 * looser copy of the same rules for a contributor's editor to check as they
 * type; `validate()` here is the one that actually decides.
