/*
 * Docs sidebar structure (docs/shep-design/README.md, "Screens > 2. Docs >
 * Sidebar"). This is the shape of the docs shell itself — which pages exist,
 * which route they live at, which group they're under — not a claim about
 * product state, so unlike docsLexicon.ts / docsRules.ts it isn't sourced
 * from a doc that drifts. `built` just means "has a real page" — every item
 * below is one today, but the field stays live rather than getting deleted:
 * a page can still be added to the sidebar (and linked from elsewhere) the
 * day it's planned, before it's written, the same way the fourteen below
 * were. Flip it false for a genuinely unwritten page and the sidebar's
 * "soon" tag picks it back up on its own.
 *
 * `source`/`spec`/`api` back the reference pills under each page's title
 * (see ReferencePills.astro) — one shared component driven by this data so
 * a new page can't ship without at least a Source pill.
