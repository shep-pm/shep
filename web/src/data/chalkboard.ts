/*
 * Landing-page chalkboard — "What's not built yet" (docs/shep-design/
 * README.md, "Screens > 1. Landing page > Chalkboard").
 *
 * Source of truth: docs/specs/deferred.md, two of its sections, kept apart
 * on the board because they mean different things.
 *
 *   - "Named as v1.0 in spec §2/§9, not yet built" is the build queue. Its
 *     items are prose paragraphs opening with a bold name (`**OTLP export
 *     (metrics dog)**`), so the anchor is that bold text.
 *   - "Committed to v1.1+ by design (spec §2)" is the deliberate cuts, and
 *     Windows is the largest. Its items are top-level `- ` bullets, some
 *     bold and some not, so the anchor is each bullet's head: its text up
 *     to the first parenthesis, em dash, or sentence end.
 *
 * A section ends at the next heading of any depth, not at the next `## `.
 * Either section can carry a `### ` subsection expanding on one of its
 * items, and that subsection's own bullets are prose about a cut rather
 * than six more cuts. Bounding at `## ` alone read all eight bullets of the
 * 2026-09-06 resource-limit sizing as new v1.1 scope and failed the build.
 *
 * Merging the two would be the easy thing and the wrong one. A cut is not a
 * queue item, and a board that showed Windows beside OTLP with no label
 * would promise a tier the maintainer ruled out of v1 on 2026-08-15.
 *
 * Both lists are parsed out of deferred.md rather than hand-copied, and
 * `checkSync` diffs parsed against curated in both directions: an item
 * deferred.md adds, ships, or renames and this file does not follow fails
 * the build instead of shipping a stale claim. A heading-only check (two
 * guards ago) cannot catch that, since the heading survives all three.
 *
 * The curated half is only the display string. Anchors are never typed by
 * hand for their own sake — they exist so the diff has something to compare.
