# Verb order matches the Commands enum's declaration order. `resurrect`, a
# hidden alias of `muster` (clap `alias`, not `visible_alias`), stays out on
# purpose so it doesn't appear in generated docs. `help` is clap's own and
# is the other deliberate omission.
#
# `every_visible_verb_reaches_the_docs_site_generator` in cli.rs checks this
# list against the binary's own visible subcommands, so a new verb fails a
# test rather than going undocumented.
